This repository demonstrates a common C programming error related to pointer arithmetic and memory management. The `bug.c` file contains code exhibiting the error, while `bugSolution.c` provides a corrected version. The error involves directly modifying a variable's value through a pointer, leading to potential issues with data integrity.  This is a fundamental concept in C programming, and understanding pointer behavior is crucial for avoiding these types of bugs.
